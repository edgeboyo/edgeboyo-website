This branch is stale and contains the previous setup of the file repository and simple notepad, written in CSS and hooked to a MySQL database.

To make it work, just inpory the two dbs outlined in [repo.sql](repo.sql) and [notepad.sql](/notepad/notepad.sql) 
and change their credentians/location in the [mysql_connect.php](mysql_connect.php) [files](/notepad/mysql_connect.php). 

Make sure to also a user in the `Users` table of `repo`. The master password for the notepad is `jimbo` and is cardcoded in [rem.php](/notepad/rem.php).

You are free to use any of it, but you shouldn't because why would you ever do PHP in this day and age?
